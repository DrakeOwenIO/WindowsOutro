# Windows Outro
Windows outro is a program that makes your shutdown expirence more exciting!

To run this program simply download "Outro.exe" and run it on your PC. WARNING: THIS WILL SHUTDOWN YOUR PC!

If you plan to compile and run this on your own system you must have a complier that supports `#pragma comment`. GCC does not support this automatically and you will have to add the flag `-lwinmm` to your complie command or makefile.
